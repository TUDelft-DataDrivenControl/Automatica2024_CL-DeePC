\section{Simulation setup}
To demonstrate and compare the performance of \ac{DeePC} and \ac{CL-DeePC} under the influence of feedback, different simulation studies are performed. The simulated plant is a marginally stable fifth-order 
model of the form \eqref{eqn:SS_innovation} that represents two circular plates that are spun by a motor with non-rigid shafts with \citep{Favoreel1999b}
\begin{align}\label{eq:SysFavoreel}

\begin{array}{lll}
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
        4.40 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
       -8.09 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
        7.83 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
       -4.00 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\

    \end{bmatrix}^\top\mkern-7mu,\\
    K = \begin{bmatrix}
        2.3 & -6.64 & 7.515 & -4.0146 & 0.86336
    \end{bmatrix}^\top\mkern-7mu,\span

Three different controllers are implemented. One controller uses \ac{DeePC} (with \ac{IVs} as proposed in \cite{vanWingerden2022}). Another uses \ac{CL-DeePC} with \ac{IVs} (implemented as described in \secref{sec:Sequential} to reduce computation time). As a benchmark, an oracle model predictive controller based on \eqref{eq:SS_iter} with perfect knowledge of the system matrices $\Gamma_f$, $\mathcal{T}_f^\mathrm{u}$ and state $x_{\hat{i}_p}$ is used.

All of the simulations are carried out in MATLAB, using CasADi \citep{Andersson2019} to formulate a quadratic program that is solved with IPOPT. Unless indicated otherwise the employed cost function weights as in \eqref{eq:cost_fun} are $Q=100$, $R=0$, and $R^\Delta=10$ and employed constraints are $|u_k-u_{k-1}|\leq3.75$, $|u_k|\leq15$, $|y_k|<1000$.
