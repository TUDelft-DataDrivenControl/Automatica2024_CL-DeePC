\section{Simulation setup}
\noindent To demonstrate and compare the performance of \ac{DeePC} and \ac{CL-DeePC} under the influence of feedback, different simulation studies are performed. The simulated plant is a marginally stable fifth-order 
model of the form \eqref{eqn:SS_innovation} that represents two circular plates that are spun by a motor with non-rigid shafts with \citep{Favoreel1999b}

Three different controllers are implemented. One controller uses \ac{DeePC} (with \ac{IVs} as proposed in \cite{vanWingerden2022}). Another uses \ac{CL-DeePC} with \ac{IVs} (implemented as described in \secref{sec:Sequential} to reduce computation time). As a benchmark, an oracle model predictive controller based on \eqref{eq:SS_iter} with perfect knowledge of the system matrices $\Gamma_f$, $\mathcal{T}_f^\mathrm{u}$ and state $x_{\hat{i}_p}$ is used.

All of the simulations are carried out in MATLAB\footnote{The employed code can be found on GitHub at $<$GitHub URL$>$ and the generated data sets are available on $<$Zenodo URL$>$.}, using CasADi \citep{Andersson2019} to formulate a quadratic program that is solved with IPOPT \citep{Wachter2006}. Unless indicated otherwise $p=f=20$, the employed cost function weights as in \eqref{eq:cost_fun} are $Q=100$, $R=0$, and $R^\Delta=10$, and employed constraints are $|u_k-u_{k-1}|\leq3.75$, $|u_k|\leq15$, $|y_k|<1000$. To prevent infeasibility these constraints are relaxed and the problem is solved again if no solution is found. This appears to be an issue with \ac{DeePC}, particularly for $\bar{N}<200$. All simulations use a step reference signal that varies between 0 and 100 with a period of 200 time steps. Simulations start by data collection in open-loop with which to initialize the data-driven controllers, which are then active together with the oracle for 1800 time steps. Unless otherwise stated, the input variance for the open-loop trajectories is $\sigma^2(u_k)=1$ and the innovation noise has a variance of $\sigma^2(e_k)=1$ throughout the simulation.
