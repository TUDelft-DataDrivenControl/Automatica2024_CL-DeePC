\section{Addressing closed-loop identification bias}\label{sec:CL_ID_issue}
% Correlation between inputs and preceding noise produces a bias for the underlying identification task in \ac{DeePC}~\citep{Dinkla2023}. This section demonstrates this issue for adaptive controller implementations using simulations.
%
\noindent By means of simulations, this section will show the superior performance of \ac{CL-DeePC} compared to \ac{DeePC}, thereby providing contribution~5. A reference tracking case is first examined. Thereafter, the closed-loop correlation between inputs and noise is visualized. Subsequently, the resulting consistency and inconsistency of respectively \ac{CL-DeePC} and \ac{DeePC} predictors is shown.

\subsection{Example of a reference tracking case}
\noindent To compare the performance of \ac{DeePC} and \ac{CL-DeePC} in an adaptive setting, consider Fig.~\ref{fig:CL_Problem_Solution}. \ac{CL-DeePC} clearly manages considerably better reference tracking performance w.r.t. \ac{DeePC}, the former performing comparably to the oracle. At first, all of the data that the data-driven controllers rely on derives from open-loop operation. Due to the adaptive nature of the controller implementation, after $\bar{N}$ time steps, all of the employed data derives from closed-loop operation. The reference tracking ability of \ac{DeePC} appears to decrease as the amount of employed closed-loop data increases. Thereafter, a cyclical behaviour may be observed for \ac{DeePC}: large reference tracking errors that result from, e.g., the closed-loop identification issue momentarily increase the signal to noise ratio and thereby temporarily improve the obtained reference tracking performance again.

\subsection{Correlation between inputs and noise}
\noindent This section demonstrates the existence of correlation between inputs and preceding noise during closed-loop operation in an adaptive setting by means of simulations. Following the preceding consistency proof in \secref{sec:Theorem1}, the correlation matrix of interest is given by $E_{i_p,f_\mathrm{ID},N}\begin{bmatrix}U_{i,p,N}^\top & U_{i_p,f_\mathrm{ID},N}^\top\end{bmatrix}$, with $f_\mathrm{ID}=f$ for \ac{DeePC}, and $f_\mathrm{ID}=1$ for \ac{CL-DeePC}. An example of such a correlation matrix, averaged over the closed-loop data obtained from 120 simulations with different noise realizations, is shown by Fig.~\ref{fig:EfUpf_correlation}. Unlike with \ac{CL-DeePC}, the input data used by \ac{DeePC} is correlated with the noise that is inherent to used, preceding output measurements. Although in adaptive data-driven implementations there is a stochastic variability associated with subsequent control policies due to noise, this variability is clearly insufficient to mitigate the closed-loop correlation that arises between inputs and preceding noise in \ac{DeePC}.

\subsection{Consistency analysis}
\noindent This section demonstrates the consistency (or lack thereof) of the estimators employed by \ac{DeePC} and \ac{CL-DeePC} as a result of closed-loop correlation between inputs and preceding noise. Along the lines of the consistency analysis in \secref{sec:Theorem1} and~\cite{Dinkla2023} it is to be expected that the implicit matrix estimate of $\mathcal{T}_{f_\mathrm{ID}}^\mathrm{u}$ is inconsistent for \ac{DeePC} ($f_\mathrm{ID}=f$) and consistent for \ac{CL-DeePC} ($f_\mathrm{ID}=1$). Note that for \ac{CL-DeePC}, the estimate of $\mathcal{T}_f^\mathrm{u}$ is implicitly constructed from the sequential construction procedure from \secref{sec:Sequential}. In anticipation of potential amplification of identification errors in the resulting matrix estimate for $\mathcal{T}_f^\mathrm{u}$, to facilitate a fair comparison, the error in $\widehat{\mathcal{T}}_f^\mathrm{u}$ is shown for both data-driven methods by Fig.~\ref{fig:Tuf_consistency}. As expected, as the number of employed past data points $\bar{N}$ increases (together with the number of columns $N=\bar{N}-p-f_\mathrm{ID}+1$), the bias of the \ac{CL-DeePC} estimate keeps decreasing, which indicates that the employed estimate is indeed consistent. In contrast, for \ac{DeePC} the bias does not keep decreasing noticeably beyond around $\bar{N}=400$, indicating that the implicitly employed estimate $\widehat{\mathcal{T}}_f^\mathrm{u}$ is inconsistent.
