\section{Introduction}
Trends of increasing data availability as well as increasing system complexity make a compelling case for data-driven control methods as an alternative to model-based approaches~\cite{Hou2013}. Whilst data can be used with indirect data-driven approaches to synthesise a model by means of system identification, direct data-driven control approaches are promising because they derive a control law directly from data without having to realize an explicit system model as an (often costly) intermediate step.

Since its conception in~\cite{Coulson2019}, a form of direct data-driven control called \ac{DeePC} has seen considerable development. \ac{DeePC} uses Willems' Fundamental Lemma from the field of behavioural systems theory, which states that for a deterministic system any sufficiently persistently exciting input-output trajectory parameterizes all possible future input-output trajectories~\cite{Willems2005}. In effect, \ac{DeePC} exploits Willems' Fundamental Lemma in a receding horizon optimal control framework found also in \ac{MPC}. For systems a

\begin{enumerate}
\item Demonstration of a closed-loop identification issue in the presence of noise that arises with regular \ac{DeePC}.
\item The development of two equivalent \ac{CL-DeePC} algorithms (using \ac{IVs}) that do not suffer from this closed-loop issue and are also more sample efficient.
\item Demonstrate an equivalence between the developed \ac{CL-DeePC} algorithm and \ac{CL-SPC}.
\item A comparison of the attained performance of the regular and closed-loop \ac{DeePC} algorithms is demonstrated by means of simulations.
