\section{Introduction}
Trends of increasing data availability as well as increasing system complexity make a compelling case for data-driven control methods as an alternative to model-based approaches~\cite{Hou2013}. Whilst data can be used with indirect data-driven approaches to synthesise a model by means of system identification, direct data-driven approaches are promising because they derive a control law directly from data without obtaining an intermediate, often costly, system realization step.


Contributions
\begin{enumerate}
\item Demonstration of a closed-loop identification issue in the presence of noise that arises with regular \ac{DeePC}.
\item The development of two equivalent \ac{CL-DeePC} algorithms (using \ac{IVs}) that do not suffer from this closed-loop issue and are also more sample efficient.
\item Demonstrate an equivalence between the developed \ac{CL-DeePC} algorithm and \ac{CL-SPC}.
\item A comparison of the attained performance of the regular and closed-loop \ac{DeePC} algorithms is demonstrated by means of simulations.
