\section{Equivalence to Closed-loop \acs{SPC}}
This section demonstrates an equivalence between the developed \ac{CL-DeePC} framework and \ac{CL-SPC} as developed in~\cite{Dong2008}. To understand this equivalence, consider the data equations \eqref{eq:DataEq1} and \eqref{eq:DataEq2}. Just like \ac{CL-DeePC}, \ac{CL-SPC} uses $s=1$ to avoid closed-loop correlation between inputs and noise,\footnote{Treatment of the detrimental effects thereof is reserved for the subsequent section.} Motivated by the simplified expressions n estimate of $\widehat{L}_1$ is obtained from linear least squares regression of
